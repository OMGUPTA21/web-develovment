        Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani (born 19 April 1957) is an Indian billionaire business magnate, and the chairman,
        managing director, and largest shareholder of Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL), a Fortune Global 500 company and
        India's most valuable company by market value.[5] He is the second richest person in Asia with a net worth of
        US$76.5 billion, and as of 23 December 2020, the 21st richest in the world.
        Early life
        Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani was born on 19 April 1957 in the British Crown colony of Aden (in present-day Yemen) to
        Dhirubhai Ambani and Kokilaben Ambani. He has a younger brother Anil Ambani and two sisters, Nina Bhadrashyam
        Kothari and Dipti Dattaraj Salgaocar.

        Ambani lived only briefly in Yemen because his father decided to move back to India in 1958[7] to start a
        trading business that focused on spices and textiles. The latter was originally named "Vimal" but later changed
        to "Only Vimal."[8] His family lived in a modest two-bedroom apartment in Bhuleshwar, Mumbai until the 1970s.[9]
        The family's financial status slightly improved when they moved to India but Ambani still lived in a communal
        society, used public transportation, and never received an allowance.[10] Dhirubhai later purchased a 14-floor
        apartment block called 'Sea Wind' in Colaba, where, until recently, Ambani and his brother lived with their
        families on different floors.[11]

        Education
        Ambani attended the Hill Grange High School at Peddar Road, Mumbai, along with his brother and Anand Jain, who
        later became his close associate.[12] After his secondary schooling, he studied at the St. Xavier's College,
        Mumbai.[13] He then received a BE degree in Chemical Engineering from the Institute of Chemical
        Technology.[14][15]

        Ambani later enrolled for an MBA at Stanford University but withdrew in 1980 to help his father build Reliance,
        which at the time was still a small but fast-growing enterprise.[16] His father felt that real-life skills were
        harnessed through experiences and not by sitting in a classroom, so he called his son back to India from
        Stanford to take command of a yarn manufacturing project in his company.[10]

        Ambani has been quoted as saying that he was influenced by his teachers William F. Sharpe and Man Mohan Sharma
        because they are "the kind of professors who made you think out of the box."[17]

        Career
        In 1981 he started to help his father Dhirubhai Ambani run their family business, Reliance Industries Limited.
        By this time, it had already expanded so that it also dealt in refining and petrochemicals. The business also
        included products and services in retail and telecommunications industries. Reliance Retail Ltd., another
        subsidiary, is also the largest retailer in India.[18] Reliance's Jio has earned a top-five spot in the
        country's telecommunication services since its public launch on 5 September 2016.

        As of 2016, Ambani was ranked 36 and has consistently held the title of India's richest person on Forbes
        magazine's list for the past ten years.[19] He is the only Indian businessman on Forbes' list of the world's
        most powerful people.[20] As of October 2020, Mukesh Ambani was ranked by Forbes as the 6th-wealthiest person in
        the world.[6] He surpassed Jack Ma, executive chairman of Alibaba Group, to become Asia's richest person with a
        net worth of $44.3 billion in July 2018. He is also the wealthiest person in the world outside North America and
        Europe.[21] As of 2015, Ambani ranked fifth among India's philanthropists, according to China's Hurun Research
        Institute.[22] He was appointed as a Director of Bank of America and became the first non-American to be on its
        board.[23]

        Through Reliance, he also owns the Indian Premier League franchise Mumbai Indians and is the founder of Indian
        Super League, a football league in India.[24] In 2012, Forbes named him one of the richest sports owners in the
        world.[25] He resides at the Antilia Building, one of the world's most expensive private residences with its
        value reaching $1 billion.[26]

        Timeline
        1980s – 1990s
        In 1980, the Indian government under Indira Gandhi opened PFY (polyester filament yarn) manufacturing to the
        private sector. Dhirubhai Ambani applied for a license to set up a PFY manufacturing plant. Obtaining the
        license was a long-drawn-out process requiring a strong connection within the bureaucracy system because the
        government, at the time, was restricting large-scale manufacturing, making the importation of yarn for the
        textiles impossible.[27] In spite of stiff competition from Tatas, Birlas and 43 others, Dhirubhai was awarded
        the license, more commonly addressed as License Raj.[28] To help him build the PFY plant, Dhirubhai pulled his
        eldest son out of Stanford, where he was studying for his MBA, to work with him in the company. Ambani did not
        return to his university program, leading Reliance's backward integration, where companies own their suppliers
        to generate more revenue and improve efficiency, in 1981 from textiles into polyester fibers and further into
        petrochemicals, which the yarns were made from.[5] After joining the company, he reported daily to Rasikbhai
        Meswani, then executive director. The company was being built from scratch with the principle of everybody
        contributing to the business and not heavily depend on selected individuals. Dhirubhai treated him as a business
        partner allowing him the freedom to contribute even with little experience.[29] This principle came into play
        after Rasikbhai's death in 1985 along with Dhirubhai suffering a stroke in 1986 when all the responsibility
        shifted to Ambani and his brother.[30] Mukesh Ambani set up Reliance Infocomm Limited (now Reliance
        Communications Limited), which was focused on information and communications technology initiatives.[31] At the
        age of 24, Ambani was given charge of the construction of Patalganga petrochemical plant when the company was
        heavily investing in oil refinery and petrochemicals.[32]

        2000s – Present
        On 6 July 2002, Mukesh's father died after suffering a second stroke,[33] which elevated tensions between the
        brothers as Dhirubhai had not left a will for the distribution of the empire in 2004.[34] Their mother
        intervened to stop the feud, splitting the company into two, Ambani receiving control of Reliance Industries
        Limited and Indian Petrochemicals Corporation Limited, which was later approved by the Bombay High Court in
        December 2005.[35][36]

        Ambani directed and led the creation of the world's largest grassroots petroleum refinery at Jamnagar, India,
        which had the capacity to produce 660,000 barrels per day (33 million tonnes per year) in 2010, integrated with
        petrochemicals, power generation, port, and related infrastructure.[37] In December 2013 Ambani announced, at
        the Progressive Punjab Summit in Mohali, the possibility of a "collaborative venture" with Bharti Airtel in
        setting up digital infrastructure for the 4G network in India.[38] On 18 June 2014, Mukesh Ambani, while
        addressing the 40th AGM of Reliance Industries, said he will invest Rs 1.8 trillion (short scale) across
        businesses in the next three years and launch 4G broadband services in 2015.[39] In February 2016, Ambani-led
        Jio launched its own 4G smartphone brand named LYF.[40] In June 2016, it was India's third-largest-selling
        mobile phone brand.[41] The release of the service Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited, commonly known as Jio, in
        September 2016 was a success, and Reliance's shares increased.[42] During the 40th annual general meeting of
        RIL, he announced bonus shares in the ratio of 1:1 which is the country's largest bonus issue in India, and
        announced the Jio Phone at an effective price of ₹0.[43] As of February 2018, Bloomberg's "Robin Hood Index"
        estimated that Ambani's personal wealth was enough to fund the operations of the Indian federal government for
        20 days.[44]

        In February 2014, a First Information Report (FIR) alleging criminal offenses was filed against Mukesh Ambani
        for alleged irregularities in the pricing of natural gas from the KG basin.[45] Arvind Kejriwal, who had a short
        stint as Delhi's chief minister and had ordered the FIR, has accused various political parties of being silent
        on the gas price issue.[46] Kejriwal has asked both Rahul Gandhi and Narendra Modi to clear their stand on the
        gas pricing issue.[47][48] Kejriwal has alleged that the Centre allowed the price of gas to be inflated to eight
        dollars a unit though Mukesh Ambani's company spends only one dollar to produce a unit, which meant a loss of
        Rs. 540 billion to the country annually.[49][50]
